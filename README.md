Live : [spotstay-in.com](https://spotstay-in.onrender.com/)<br/>

Developed a full-stack web application inspired by Airbnb using the MVC architecture.<br/>

Implemented user authentication and authorization with Passport.js to ensure secure login, signup, and role-based access control.<br/>

Enabled registered users to list rental properties with title, description, photos, pricing, and geocoded map locations (Mapbox integration).<br/>

Only listing owners can edit/delete their properties; authenticated users can add/delete reviews they authored.<br/>

Designed RESTful API routes with Express, used Joi for schema validation, and handled errors with custom middleware and error pages.<br/>

Utilized MongoDB relations (One-to-Few, One-to-Many) to store listings, users, and reviews.<br/>

Used EJS templating with EJS-Mate and styled with Bootstrap and custom CSS.<br/>

Deployed on Render.com for production hosting.<br/>
